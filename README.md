This repository contains a sample SwiftUI registration app and a Python script.

- `RegistrationForm.swift` – SwiftUI app for iOS and macOS to record athlete registrations, view session data, and export a CSV file.
- `Registration_Form.py` – original Python implementation of the registration logic.

To build the SwiftUI app, open `RegistrationForm.swift` in Xcode 15 or later.
